Hello, everyone! 

I have reached the end of 2st coding period and it's time for the 2nd evaluation. In these last weeks of 2st coding phase I worked on changing the old functions so that they now work successfully.. I also started using PyCharm again after a long time for debugging. I've opened PR for all the functions as specified in my proposal before the 2nd evaluation except the one about creating NetCDF to csv conversion as there were some issues. I'm modifying the code according to the review given by my mentors to make sure the code is upto standards. I've added these functions to be used in `retriever autocreate` to autocreate scripts for testing these functions except the NetCDF one.
### Pull Requests made during this period
* [PR#1507](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1507) - json to csv file conversion function through scripts
* [PR#1506](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1506) - XML to csv file conversion function through scripts
* [PR#1505](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1505) - SQLite to csv files conversion function through scripts
* [PR#1504](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1504) - GeoJSON to csv files conversion function through scripts

### Future Work
 In the 2nd coding phase I will complete the PR for the remaining conversion function(NetCDF to csv) till it is enough to be merged while working on further tasks which are 
* Adding ingestion functions based on the functions added in [engine_tools.py](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/blob/e6c54e6d870d9611502469e38247ce9276c9c8e0/retriever/lib/engine_tools.py) earlier.
* Testing, Debugging and Documentation of these function added in this period.
 
I am communicating with my mentors through Gitter.
